Atmel-CricketCalls
==================

For Project 2 we had to simulate cricket calls with the Atmel. Output was through a spliced RCA cable to a black and white tv. We had to taken in different parameters as entered through a keypad of frequency, chirp length, chirp silence, and others. For use in further labs, Rich developed a keypad library.

This was based off of a lab I did with a partner as part of undergraduate work. I don't intend to do any more work on this, but I wanted the file to be out here in Github.
